# DL – Fine-Tuning Transformers for Text Classification

The project focuses on fine-tuning pretrained transformer models for text classification tasks using the Yelp Polarity dataset.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to apply **transfer learning** in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by:

- Fine-tuning pretrained transformer models (like BERT, RoBERTa)
- Classifying customer reviews from the **Yelp Polarity** dataset
- Leveraging Hugging Face pipelines and tokenizers
- Evaluating model performance across different scenarios

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Files

- `dl_nlp_transformers.ipynb` – Contains model fine-tuning, training, evaluation, and conclusions.
